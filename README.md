\# DevSecOps Investigation Journey: An Analytical Case Study of "Shift-Left" Security



\## 📖 Project Overview

This project investigates the trade-offs of \*\*DevSecOps\*\* practices, focusing on the balance between \*\*performance overhead\*\* and \*\*security efficacy\*\* in CI/CD pipelines.  

It provides a practical, empirical case study of "Shift-Left" security by integrating static analysis (SAST) and software composition analysis (SCA) tools into a Spring Boot pipeline.

\## 🎯 Objectives

\- Measure the \*\*cost\*\* (pipeline runtime overhead) of adding security gates.

\- Evaluate the \*\*benefit\*\* (ability to detect and block vulnerabilities).

\- Provide analytical conclusions on tool reliability, performance trade-offs, and enforcement policies.

\## 🛠️ Technical Stack

\- \*\*Language/Framework\*\*: Java (Spring Boot)

\- \*\*Build Tool\*\*: Maven

\- \*\*Version Control \& CI/CD\*\*: GitHub Actions

\- \*\*Security Tools\*\*:

&nbsp; - SonarQube / SonarCloud (SAST)

&nbsp; - Snyk (SCA)

&nbsp; - OWASP Dependency-Check (attempted, failed)

\## 📊 Experimental Phases



\### Phase 1: Baseline Pipeline

\- Built a clean CI/CD pipeline for Spring Boot.

\- \*\*Baseline runtime\*\*: 43 seconds.



\### Phase 2: Performance Experimentation (Cost)

\- \*\*SonarQube (SAST)\*\*: +14s overhead (total 57s).

\- \*\*OWASP Dependency-Check (SCA)\*\*: Failed due to NVD API errors.

\- \*\*Snyk (SCA)\*\*: +26s overhead (total 1m 23s). Reliable and fast compared to OWASP.



\### Phase 3: Efficacy Experimentation (Benefit)

\- \*\*SCA Test\*\*: Injected `log4j-core@2.14.1` (Log4Shell vulnerability).  

&nbsp; → Build failed as expected (`--fail-on=high` policy enforced).

\- \*\*SAST Test\*\*: Planted SQL Injection + Hardcoded Password.  

&nbsp; → SonarCloud flagged issues, Quality Gate failed.



\### Phase 4: Fix Cycle (Pass)

\- Removed vulnerable dependency (Log4j).  

\- Reviewed and remediated SonarCloud hotspots.  

\- Corrected compilation/package issues.  

\- Final pipeline: \*\*Green ✅\*\*, Quality Gate: \*\*Passed\*\*.

\## 📌 Key Findings

\- \*\*Tool Reliability Matters\*\*: OWASP Dependency-Check proved unstable; Snyk provided consistent results.  

\- \*\*Performance Overhead is Acceptable\*\*: ~40s increase justified by catching critical vulnerabilities.  

\- \*\*Policy Enforcement is Essential\*\*: Scanners must enforce fail-on policies to block insecure deployments.  

\- \*\*Full Cycle Achieved\*\*: Find → Fail → Fix → Pass.
